## 2048

This is a replica of the very known game 2048. 
This game was developed for myself to learn Go and ebitenengine


To run you need to build the game. No executables provided at the moment. So you need to have Go installed. 

To run the game;\
`go run .`

To run all the test cases you can run test.sh. It also generates coverage report and tries to open it. (you might have to modify kde-open section with whatever you have)\
`./test.sh`
